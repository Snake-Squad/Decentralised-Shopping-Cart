# Decentralised-Shopping-Cart

This Project is to implement a decentralised shopping cart. Similar to a classical shopping cart application, the decentralised shopping cart supports operations such as adding items, removing items, calculating prices, searching items, purchasing etc. However, typical online shopping systems may contain extra charge from sellers. More than that, traditional online shopping applications suffer security issues such as DDoS, SQL injection and cross-site scripting attack. One solution is to make the application decentralised. In a decentralised shopping application, all trades happen directly between buyers and sellers with no middleman to take a cut from each sale. In terms of security, essential components have been distributed using the blockchain. Such property makes it practically impossible and expensive to attack.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
