week 2 

Our group formed on Tuesday. My group members are Minzhen Ye, Wenjie Gao, Yanjie Hu, Yufei Zhang.
We created the Trello & Bitbucket accounts for the team(After class, we replaced Bitbucket by GitHub).
I skimmed through the tutorials and understood a little of the Ethereum Blockchain. 
In addition, we are going to consult tutor Huang and get some useful knowledge on Sunday.

week 3

I wrote the aim part of proposal with a ER diagram with Minzhen and i found a problem about permissions. 
I discussed it with scrum master and the final decision is to use buyers and sellers, because all trades 
happen directly between buyers and sellers with no middleman to take a cut from each sale.
Later i installed all prerequisites, set up the coding environment and also learned javascript and solidity. 
However, i think i need one more week to learn them.
