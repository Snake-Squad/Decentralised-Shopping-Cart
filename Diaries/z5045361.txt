week 2 

Our group formed on Tuesday. My group members are Minzhen Ye, Wenjie Gao, Yanjie Hu, Yufei Zhang.
We created the Trello & Bitbucket accounts for the team(After class, we replaced Bitbucket by GitHub).
I skimmed through the tutorials and understood a little of the Ethereum Blockchain. 
In addition, we are going to consult tutor Huang and get some useful knowledge on Sunday.
